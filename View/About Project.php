    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 1. The goal of this project is to create a "Online Bidding System", which would allow buyers and sellers to trade nearly anything online.<br><br>

    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 2. User can see the feature of this site without registration but for Bidding and selling user must be registrated.<br><br>

    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 3. Auctions have a name, a description, a photo uploaded by users and an end period.<br><br>

     &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 4. Administrators have the power to accept or refuse auctions proposed by users, to view information about users and items and to create, modify and delete. </h3>
